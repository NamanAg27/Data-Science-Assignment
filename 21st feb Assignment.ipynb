    "E-commerce: Web scraping is used by businesses to monitor prices and product availability on competitor websites. This allows them to adjust their pricing and inventory levels in real-time to stay competitive in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing: Web scraping is used by marketers to collect data on customer behavior, such as which pages they visit, how long they stay on a page, and what products they view. This data can be used to personalize marketing campaigns and improve conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research: Web scraping is used by researchers to collect data for academic studies, such as analyzing social media sentiment or tracking changes in public opinion. It is also used in the fields of finance, healthcare, and politics to gather data on market trends, patient outcomes, and public policy."
